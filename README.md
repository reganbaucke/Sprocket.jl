Sprocket: (S)tochastic (PRO)gramming

Sprocket is a framework for describing stochastic programmes in an
algorithm-agnostic fashion.

Once a problem has been described, the user can implement an algorithm to solve
the problem, or she can use an algorithm that we've prepared earlier.
Sprocket was developed to compare the speeds of different solution
algorithms in a fair and consistent manner. Besides this, Sprocket is a great
way to write and solve your stochastic programme!

## Problem Class / Decomposition
Sprocket solves stochastic optimisation problems where uncertainty appears in
the objective function. Currently, there is no support for optimisation problems
with chance constraints or with random feasible sets.

## Bugs
Please raise an `issue' if you experience an error while using Sprocket.
